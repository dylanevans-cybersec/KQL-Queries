üõ°Ô∏è Threat Hunting & Analytic Rule KQL Repository
Welcome to my personal repository for Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries focused on threat hunting and analytic rule development!

üöÄ Purpose
This repository serves as a centralized collection for KQL queries I develop and refine for various security operations tasks, including:

Proactive Threat Hunting: Identifying suspicious activities and potential threats that may bypass existing security controls.

Analytic Rule Development: Creating robust detection rules for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel) to automatically flag malicious behavior.

Incident Response: Assisting with investigations by providing quick access to queries for data exploration and analysis.

My goal is to continuously build, test, and improve these queries to enhance detection capabilities and streamline security investigations.
